        <h2>How to record the screen on Windows 10 with OBS</h2>
        <body>If your PC runs on Windows 8 (including 8.1) or 10, you're good to go. You can download the appropriate software version from the official website. You'll be asked to state whether you'll be using OBS for broadcasting or screen recording during the installation process, so keep that in mind.</body>
        <body>Once you've downloaded it to your computer, follow these steps for screen recording:</body>
        <ol> 
            <li>Open OBS Studio. Typically, the software will automatically add a Scene after launching. If not, click on the + icon in the Scenes box at the screen's bottom-left corner. </li>
            <li>Navigate to the Sources box right next to Scenes and click the + icon at the bottom of the panel.</li>
            <li>Now, select Display Capture from the options menu.</li>
            <li>A small pop-up window will appear, add a title and click OK.</li>
            <li>Another pop-up will appear. If you have multiple monitors, click on the little downward arrow to access a drop-down list. Pick the display you'd like to capture and hit OK.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the bottom-right corner of the screen and click Settings.</li>
            <li>A new window will appearâ€”select Output from the sidebar on the left-hand side.</li>
            <li>Under Recording Path, choose a destination for your file.</li>
            <li>Once you're done, click the blue Start Recording button in the lower-right corner of the screen.</li>

        </ol>
